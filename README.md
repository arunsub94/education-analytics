This repo contains code used for design of the Statistics course for a business-oriented Data Science program. Using webscrapped data from job sites such as Indeed, Monster & ZipRecruiter, coupled with course content & syllabus from highly-rated online courses on platforms such as ClassCentral, analytics was employed to design the Statistics course for a Data Science & Analytics program with a business focus. This involved visual analytics on collected using Matplotlib and Plotly Python visualization platforms and running hierarchical clustering algorithms to group relevant course material together to generate the curriculum. This was a team effort along with 5 other teammates, each of whom designed indivdual courses that were put together to form the basis of the business-oriented Data Science program. This was the submitted course project for MIE1624: Introduction to Data Science & Analytics.
